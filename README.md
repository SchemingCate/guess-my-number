# GUESS MY NUMBER

'Guess my number' is a _**study project**_ I did on [The complete JavaScript course by Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/). 

This is a first project in this course, and my first JS project, to get acquainted with DOM manipulation. 

The HTML and CSS files were provided by the course.
